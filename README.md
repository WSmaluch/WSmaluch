## What I Do Best 👨‍💻
While I've delved into frontend projects in ASP.NET, my true expertise lies in backend development. I specialize in crafting entire web services and find immense satisfaction in bringing projects to life. Currently, I am actively seeking employment opportunities to apply my programming skills and contribute to innovative projects.

## My Projects and Learning Journey 📚
<ul>
<li>🛸The first big project I created is a Space Invaders game in Java Swing. The application encompasses an interactive shooter game, utilizing inheritance, event handling, threads, and communication between the client and server. I achieved this by creating 16 custom classes and employing various Java mechanisms, such as sorting using a comparator and file handling to save player data. The most significant challenge was managing threads correctly, which I resolved by adjusting the code and avoiding blocking the main application thread.
<li>🏢I've developed an ERP system project using Entity Framework and LINQ. I designed features like invoice generation, employee administration, and order processing. I constructed data models and utilized Entity Framework for object-relational mapping. Through LINQ, I optimized data operations, enabling seamless search, filter, and sort functionalities.
<li>🚗I developed a car dealership system in PHP, featuring functionalities like user authentication, mechanic and car management, as well as repair services scheduling. The system utilizes MySQL for data storage and includes features for adding, editing, and filtering mechanics, cars, and repairs, along with user-friendly interfaces for seamless user experience.
<li>🍪"Cakezone" is a bakery project built with the Laravel framework and Bootstrap, utilizing SQL and PHP. The system facilitates the management of employees, products, and orders, offering seamless functionalities for easy addition and tracking of bakery-related data.
<li>🍕My next project is a mobile application created in Xamarin. It's a simple food ordering tool designed for ease of use and quick access to restaurant menus. The application allows users to browse available dishes and place orders. Using Xamarin technology, the project ensures a uniform and responsive user experience across mobile platforms.
<li>🎥My next significant project involves a cinema system developed in ASP.NET Core, marking my most substantial achievement so far. The project includes content management and ticket reservation functionalities. The intranet application allows administrators to manage movies, offers, and customer-related content. The public-facing website enables users to browse offers, currently playing movies, and make seat reservations. Upon reservation, the system generates a unique PDF ticket with a QR code for the user. Technologies used include ASP.NET Core and JavaScript, ensuring a comprehensive and interactive user experience.
<li>🧳Currently, I am working on another project using ASP.NET technology, focusing on a hotel management system. Within this project, I am enhancing functionalities such as room reservation, availability management, payment processing, and report generation. This project allows me to further develop my skills in web application programming and expand my knowledge of management systems.
